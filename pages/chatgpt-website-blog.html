          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>As you can visually see, ChatGPT is no replacement for imagination and designs, yes this website looks like a high school project from 2009 (one of the reasons i just want to post it is to move on to make it better) but for the tool itself. <br>
            You've probably seen those posts on LinkedIn, "the 10 AI tools you need to learn now to not fall behind", "If you arent using ChatGPT everyone will pass you".<Br>
            Has it been useful, sure. Are there probably a lot of things I could do with it that I havnt even thought of, of course. But currently, I dont feel anyone is going to be hired because they can prompt ChatGPT well, nothing done here couldnt have been done by an experienced engineer in far less time, or by watching the right youtube video. Further to this, when you get to the complex problems, the massive repos of hundreds of files and hundreds of thousands of lines of code, you cant just paste them in to the text box like I did and say "tell me what the issue is". <br>
            The real reason I used ChatGPT for this is becuase when I tried to search for this on youtube the only videos I got were about why I should make a website, and which free vs paid builder sites I can use. ChatGPT is what you imagine Google is before you actually press search and get 17 advertisments, and the entire front page being tailored by companies who have precisely and explicitly defined their content expressly to hit the first page for what you've searched. I didnt want to use one of these sites. But with more ease you could create the same thing that would look much better.<Br>
            So what are your goals? If its to do something specific like making a website, thousends of people have already thought of the best way to make you do the least work to achieve that, but if its to learn how to do it, ChatGPT has been pretty good. I didnt put all the interactions as this is long enough as it is, but frequently if I have a problem it would give multiple suggestions of how to fix, if I wanted to do somethign it would give me multiple ways to achieve it.<br>
            And I think for me, most importantly, its given me confidence to just give stuff a go, a major hurdle is not knowing where to start, this is perfect for that.
            Dont become reliant on it, but learn how it works and get the most out of it. <br>
            (Now I just need to ask it how I go about hosting a website)</p>
