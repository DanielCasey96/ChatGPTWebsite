    <h1>How I made this Website with only ChatGPT Prompts</h1>

    <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
    <p>As part of doing this project i had to recognise a couple of aspects. My day job is being an engineer and i know how to research topics. <br>
       The result of this meant to get a true reflection of the capabilities of ChatGPT in regards to me, not only someone with literally 0 experience in web dev, but 0 experience with html, css or javascript (past making a couple of post request postman scripts), i had to make sure i limited myself only to ChatGPT, this meant no googling specific issues, no watching youtube videos, and no asking friends who are Web Developers themselves. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>The End Goal</h2>
    <p>As with any project, goal, or plan, there needs to be something at the end where you can reflect and say you completed what you set out to do. Its so easy to constantly want to improve and just tweak this or that thing, and before you know it years have passed and you havnt shown anyone anything. So for me i set a couple of targets i wanted to achieve before publishing on LinkedIn. <br>
    </p>   
        <ul>
            <li>The Website need a page for the post, but also a home page and a contacts page</li>
            <li>It needs to have a level of presentation (cant have a user thinking the page didnt load, but i have no CSS)</li>
            <li>The website needs to be navicable</li>
          </ul>
        
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>      
    <p>The first prompt was the easiest:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"I want to make a website using CSS and JavaScript, write me a basic framework in JavaScript"</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>I was given a html and CSS file. Nothing extravegant but it created enough that it had some navigation buttons, a footer, and some placeholder text in the middle. Great start. <Br>
       Or it would have been, but im no Web Dev, ive not really even used Visual Studio Code before, so a small issue to fix was next:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"how do i add javascript in visual studio code"</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>Easy enough to get an answer to. As i now have a very basic repo of a website, I wanted to take a look at it: </p>  
    <blockquote>
    <p>"cool, ive added the basic css html and javascript files to a visual studio code project, what do i need to do to build the project and host it on a localhost port?"</p>
          </blockquote>
    <p>I then got the relevant information of how to intall npm and the commands needed to deploy locally. I had a small issue with npm but I was able to past the error and get options to remediate (in this case, restart Visual Studio Code). <Br>
       I tried a couple of other things to test how ChatGPT works, like asking it to repeat a response from further up the conversation. It did this no issue, </p>
