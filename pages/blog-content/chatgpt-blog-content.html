    <h1>How I made this Website with only ChatGPT Prompts</h1>

    <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
    <p>As part of doing this project i had to recognise a couple of aspects. My day job is being an engineer and i know how to research topics. <br>
       The result of this meant to get a true reflection of the capabilities of ChatGPT in regards to me, not only someone with literally 0 experience in web dev, but 0 experience with html, css or javascript (past making a couple of post request postman scripts), i had to make sure i limited myself only to ChatGPT, this meant no googling specific issues, no watching youtube videos, and no asking friends who are Web Developers themselves. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>The End Goal</h2>
    <p>As with any project, goal, or plan, there needs to be something at the end where you can reflect and say you completed what you set out to do. Its so easy to constantly want to improve and just tweak this or that thing, and before you know it years have passed and you havnt shown anyone anything. So for me i set a couple of targets i wanted to achieve before publishing on LinkedIn. <br>
    </p>   
        <ul>
            <li>The Website need a page for the post, but also a home page and a contacts page</li>
            <li>It needs to have a level of presentation (cant have a user thinking the page didnt load, but i have no CSS)</li>
            <li>The website needs to be navicable</li>
          </ul>
        
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>      
    <p>The first prompt was the easiest:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"I want to make a website using CSS and JavaScript, write me a basic framework in JavaScript"</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>I was given a html and CSS file. Nothing extravegant but it created enough that it had some navigation buttons, a footer, and some placeholder text in the middle. Great start. <Br>
       Or it would have been, but im no Web Dev, ive not really even used Visual Studio Code before, so a small issue to fix was next:</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"how do i add javascript in visual studio code"</p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>Easy enough to get an answer to. As i now have a very basic repo of a website, I wanted to take a look at it: </p>  
    <blockquote>
    <p>"cool, ive added the basic css html and javascript files to a visual studio code project, what do i need to do to build the project and host it on a localhost port?"</p>
          </blockquote>
    <p>I then got the relevant information of how to intall npm and the commands needed to deploy locally. I had a small issue with npm but I was able to past the error and get options to remediate (in this case, restart Visual Studio Code). <Br>
       I tried a couple of other things to test how ChatGPT works, like asking it to repeat a response from further up the conversation. It did this no issue, perminance of the chat is one of the best aspect of ChatGPT especially in projects like this. Way later in the process I was concerned at what would happen when I went to bed, how would I get it to know what work had already been done, to get back to the same place being able to ask the same questions? Its not an issue, the chat perminance is perminance, im not going to test it, but as long as you dont actively exit out, the chat remains (you can also have more than 1 chat if you have mutiple projects). <Br>
       At this point i had a very basic locally hosted Website. With no experience in this area of development, this was achived in about 30 mins (I was also watch a twitch stream). <Br>
       Inital take away? If you have done I think even this a single time before youd probably get to the same place in about 10 minutes, if your experienced, youd probably not only do it faster, but also have set up things for the future, like folder structures etc, this isnt going to replace Comp Sci, or having a mentor yet. But not having that available, this is great close to equal. <br>
       Does this opinon change if we want to do something a bit more challenging?
    </p>    
    <h2>Creating a new page</h2>  
    <p>Time to increase the output, one of my goals was to have a page for this blog, so at some point I was going to have to find out how that was done, but i didnt really want to do any thinking.</p>
    <blockquote>"in this project we have a value of Contact which has references around the project as being intended as a button to go to a new page, how do i both create this page and ensure it links when i click that button?"</blockquote>
    <p>I thought it would be enought to essentially be given the entirely of the code, but it gave me instructions on how to create a new page instead. Combining this with a follow up asking for basic html for that page meant I went from having no idea to having it done in about 30 seconds.</p>
