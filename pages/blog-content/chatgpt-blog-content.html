    <h1>How I made this Website with only ChatGPT Prompts</h1>

    <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
    <p>As part of doing this project I had to recognise a couple of aspects. My day job is being an engineer and I know how to research topics. <br>
       The result of this meant to get a true reflection of the capabilities of ChatGPT in regards to me, not only someone with literally 0 experience in web dev, but 0 experience with html, css or javascript (past making a couple of post request postman scripts), i had to make sure i limited myself only to ChatGPT, this meant no googling specific issues, no watching youtube videos, and no asking friends who are Web Developers themselves. <br>
    </p>

    <h2>The End Goal</h2>
    <p>As with any project, goal, or plan, there needs to be something at the end where you can reflect and say you completed what you set out to do. Its so easy to constantly want to improve and just tweak this or that thing, and before you know it years have passed and you havnt shown anyone anything. So for me i set a couple of targets i wanted to achieve before publishing on LinkedIn. <br>
    </p>   
        <ul>
            <li>The Website need a page for the post, but also a home page and a contact page</li>
            <li>It needs to have a level of presentation (not winning any awards, but more than black text on a white screen)</li>
            <li>The website needs to be navicable</li>
          </ul>
        
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>      
    <p>The first prompt was the easiest:</p>
    <blockquote>"I want to make a website using CSS and JavaScript, write me a basic framework in JavaScript"</blockquote>
    <p>I was given a html and CSS file. Nothing extravegant but it created enough that it had some navigation buttons, a footer, and some placeholder text in the middle. Great start. <Br>
       Or it would have been, but im no Web Dev, ive not really even used Visual Studio Code before, so a small issue to fix was next:</p>
    <blockquote>"how do I add javascript in visual studio code"</blockquote>
    <p>Easy enough to get an answer to. As I now have a very basic repo of a website, I wanted to take a look at it: </p>  
    <blockquote>"cool, ive added the basic css html and javascript files to a visual studio code project, what do I need to do to build the project and host it on a localhost port?"</blockquote>
    <p>I then got the relevant information of how to intall npm and the commands needed to deploy locally. I had a small issue with npm but I was able to past the error and get options to remediate (in this case, restart Visual Studio Code). <Br>
       I tried a couple of other things to test how ChatGPT works, like asking it to repeat a response from further up the conversation. It did this no issue, perminance of the chat is one of the best aspects of ChatGPT especially in projects like this. Way later in the process I was concerned at what would happen when I went to bed, how would I get it to know what work had already been done, to get back to the same place being able to ask the same questions? Its not an issue, the chat perminance is perminant, im not going to test it, but as long as you dont actively exit out, the chat remains (you can also have more than 1 chat if you have mutiple projects). <Br>
       At this point I had a very basic locally hosted Website. With no experience in this area of development, this was achived in about 30 mins (I was also watching a twitch stream). <Br>
       Inital take away? If you've done something similar even a single time before youd probably get to the same place in about 10 minutes, if youre experienced, youd probably not only do it faster, but also have set up things for the future, like folder structures etc, this isnt going to replace Comp Sci, or having a mentor yet. But not having that available, this is great. <br>
       Does this opinon change if we want to do something a bit more challenging?
    </p>    
    <h2>Creating a new page</h2>  
    <p>Time to increase the output, one of my goals was to have a page for this blog, so at some point I was going to have to find out how that was done, but I didnt really want to do any thinking.</p>
    <blockquote>"in this project we have a value of Contact which has references around the project as being intended as a button to go to a new page, how do I both create this page and ensure it links when I click that button?"</blockquote>
    <p>I thought it would be enought to essentially be given the entirely of the code, but it gave me instructions on how to create a new page instead. Combining this with a follow up asking for basic html for that page meant I went from having no idea to having it done in about 30 seconds. <br>
       This general process continued till i had a header image, a few pages, and buttons that do things when you hover over them.</p>     
    <h2>The Navigation Tree Incident</h2>
    <p>Up till this point I was riding pretty high, id created a decent amount and felt confident that anything I wanted to do I could. And then I decided I wanted to show a navigation tree...</p>
    <p>Something like this:</p>
    <img src="../../images/good-navigation-tree.png" alt="good navigation tree" style="width: 400px; height: auto; margin-left: 60px;">
    <p>So i wrote my first prompt</p>
    <blockquote>"actually ill come back to this, as ive created a new html page from this button, the user could be confused of where they are in the website, id like to start making a navigation tree and have it displayed on the webpage, here i would like this new page to sit under a blogs category
      And lets also add this blogs space to the navigation bar"</blockquote>
    <p>I got some html, I got some css, I got this:</p>
    <img src="../../images/bad-navigation-tree-2.png" alt="bad navigation tree" style="width: 400px; height: auto; margin-left: 60px;">
    <p>Ok not what I wanted, lets try to nail it down a bit more</p>
    <blockquote>"I want the tree to be left aligned and also look like this <br>
      blogs> Website creation with chatGPT"</blockquote>
    <p>It gave me some updates and told me "the navigation tree will be left-aligned, and the "Blogs" category will have a dropdown menu containing the specific blog post link."<br>
       It was not left aligned. So I knew it was going to be a bit of a process to get to what I wanted, I wont show all the back and forth but these are the commands i tried:</p>
    <blockquote>"it still isnt left aligned, or looking like a path <br>
      blogs>chatGpt"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"lets restart this <br>

      I have html code of <br>
      <em>paste of code</em> <br>
      Where I want to make a nagivation tree displayed on screen on the left side in the form <br>
      parent>child <br>
      where parent is the blogs page, and the child is the current page of website-creation.html <br>
      my css file is<br>
      <em>paste of code</em> <br>
      the webpage does not show what I want it to show </blockquote>

    <blockquote>"nope I just have a hyperlink of blog sitting in the middle of the screen<br>
      I want it to be on the left in a format <br>
      blogs>website Creation <br>
      look how this website does it at the top with <br>
      home > Cool Backgrounds <br>
      https://coolbackgrounds.io/ "</blockquote>  

    <blockquote>"ok, both text elements are there now the blog and the website creation <br>
      but they are still in the middle of the screen one under the other, I do not want this I want it on the left of the screen as <br>
      blog > website creation"</blockquote>  
    
    <blockquote>"ok, its now left aligned but still in this format <br>
      blogs <br>
      website creation <br>
      I want it to be <br>
      blogs > website creation"</blockquote>  
    
    <blockquote>"I want you to show me visually you understand the concept of what we are trying to get to"</blockquote>  

    <blockquote>"no we've gone backwards again now its just the word blogs in the middle of the screen"</blockquote>

    <blockquote>"stop writing code, it isnt correct <br>
      I want you to show me an image of a website, where it has a navigation tree of the format <br>
      home > other page"</blockquote>

    <blockquote>"ok you understand the concept of child pages I simply want to display this visually by having parent page followed by the character > followed by the child page </blockquote>  
    
    <p>So how did I finally get it to work, what was the magic combination of letters and words that allowed me to finally achieve what you can see at the top of this page?</p>
    <blockquote>"no <br>
      go to this website <br>
       https://coolbackgrounds.io/ <br>
      at the top you can see the page tree is shown as <br>
          Home â€º Cool Backgrounds <br>
      do you understand this visual representation of the parent, child pages?</blockquote>

    <p>I then go the css and html for it to work.</p>  
    <p>Sounds like a me problem? <br>
       For sure, if you ask the right questions you will get the right answers, but this is an early stage of creating a website, and already ive had a massive issue due my lack of knowledge, most people likely dont know the term navigation tree, or parent and child in this regard, I later found out this is called a breadcrumb trail.<br>
      Afterwards I came back and asked:</p>
    <blockquote>"write me html and css for adding a bradcrumb trail"</blockquote>  
    <p>And this is what I got:</p>
    <img src="../../images/bredcrumb.png" alt="breadcrumb" style="width: 400px; height: auto; margin-left: 60px;">
    <p>Strange what using the right words the first time will get you.</p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>You've probably seen those posts on LinkedIn, "the 10 AI tools you need to learn now to not fall behind", "If you arent using ChatGPT everyone will pass you".<Br>
       Has it been useful, sure. Are there probably a lot of things I could do with it that I havnt even thought of, of course. But currently, I dont feel anyone is going to be hired because they can prompt ChatGPT well, nothing done here couldnt have been done by an experienced engineer in far less time, or by watching the right youtube video. Further to this, when you get to the complex problems, the massive repos of hundreds of files and hundreds of thousends of lines of code, you cant just paste them in to the text box like I did and say "tell me what the issue is". <br>
       The real reason I used ChatGPT for this is becuase when I tried to search for this on youtube the only videos I got were about why I should make a website, and which free vs paid builder sites I can use. ChatGPT is what you imagine Google is before you actually press search and get 17 advertisments, and the entire front page being tailored by companies who have precisely and explicitly defined their content expressly to hit the first page for what youve searched. I didnt want to use one of these sites but it does allow a great segway to todays sponsor, Squarespace.com, wait, this isnt youtube. But with more ease you could create the same thing that would look much better.<Br>
       So what are your goals? If its to do something specific like making a website, thousends of people have already thought of the best way to make you do the least work to achieve that, but if its to learn how to do it, ChatGPT has been pretty good. I didnt put all the interactions as this is long enough as it is, but frequently if I have a problem it would give multiple suggestions of how to fix, if I wanted to do somethign it would give me multiple ways to achieve it.<br>
       And I think for me, most importantly, its given me confidence to just give stuff a go, a major hurdle is not knowing where to start, this is perfect for that.
       Dont become reliant on it, but learn how it works and get the most out of it. <br>
       (Now I just need to ask it how I go about hosting a website)</p>

     <p>For those interested, this is the full git repo. I plan to improve this site massively not im not tied to only prompting so ill fork from this.<br>
